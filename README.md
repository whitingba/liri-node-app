# liri-node-app

1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
Currently, this app will allow the user to search by artist and see upcoming concerts.

2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
As of right now, it is only allowing the user to find concerts, nothing else.

3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
In the terminal while in the app's directory you will type on the command line 'node liri.js --with a band name inserted here--'  
example: node liri.js Korn

4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
These can be found in the directory /images of app working/concert_search.png


5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
https://whitingba.github.io/liri-node-app/
(Though I thought the instructions said this app could not be deployed)

6. Clearly list the technologies used in the app
Used axios to fetch the data from Bandsintown.com
Used moment.js package to 'translate' the date of the concerts

7. State your role in the app development
